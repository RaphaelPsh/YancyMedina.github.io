					<li>CMSC 12. Nothing quite beats the first subject all about programming. Putting aside discrete mathematics, data structures and machine languages, a subject all about programming and writing code is always the most fun.</li>
					<li>Ethics. A GE is a subject that everyone must go through regardless of their career. Ethics is the only subject I have had that made me agree with this statement. Ethics is less of a subject and more of a way of life, a reflection of past and future actions. It made me reflect on everything I have done and what I considered good or evil, true, or false. It is a subject that everyone should go through.</li>
					<li>Python. I can go on about how it is very easy to program in python and how it is widely used but, in the end, it is honestly because I like how easy it is to display results through print in python.</li>
